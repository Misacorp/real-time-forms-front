# Real Time Forms Front

This project is an extremely simple and limited front-end to create and view your own questions on the [Real Time Forms API](https://github.com/Misacorp/real-time-forms). The main benefit is the [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) powered login used to generate API keys. An API key is required to interact with the Real Time Forms API and, while one can be set arbitrarily, logging in with Auth0 eliminates the need to remember which key was used. 

## TODO
Plenty of features are lacking or non-existant:

* Implement interactions with all API endpoints, including viewing respones to questions.
* Improve interface.
* Verify Auth0 tokens.
